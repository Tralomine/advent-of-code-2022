# advent of code 2022
I'm using this opportunity to learn rust, and I'll try to do the challenges entirely in code instead of simplifying to death with regex like last year
maybe this time, now that I setup a git and everything I'll manage to actually finish it

well we are the 3 and I still haven't started yet, but for my defense it was my girlfriend's birthday

ahah lmao 4 days now (I was tired okay)

it is 4 am why am I still awake

(yes I skipped day 7, I'll just get to it later)

see? 7 wasn't even *that* hard (I hate parsers)

I gave up on 16.2 for now and I'm now trying to catch up the last few days because I was too sick to do anything

woke up, wrote a function in less than 5 minutes, it works, and the second challenge require literally just 2 more lines from that, okay brain

22.2 is hardcoded for my puzzle input, you'll need to change the cube wrapping if you want to apply it to yours, I was too lazy to make a general function for that one

probably won't do 24 and 25 right away
