# advent of code 2022
I'm using this opportunity to learn rust, and I'll try to do the challenges entirely in code instead of simplifying to death with regex like last year
maybe this time, now that I setup a git and everything I'll manage to actually finish it

well we are the 3 and I still haven't started yet, but for my defense it was my girlfriend's birthday

ahah lmao 4 days now (I was tired okay)

it is 4 am why am I still awake

(yes I skipped day 7, I'll just get to it later)

see? 7 wasn't even *that* hard (I hate parsers)
